# ThirdSpareMain - The ThirdSpare Server Plugin

Gradle & 1.18 Fork of ThirdSpareMain (ThirdSparePlugin). It was simpler to fork code and set up a new project clean 
using Gradle instead of Maven - As suggested by the PaperMC community as of Minecraft 1.17.

This plugin is a personal "and the kitchen sink" type of plugin to be used on any of our "Thirdspare" servers. The 
plugin aims to replace an essential, economy, backpack, and friend system plugins. It has a goal of being easy to read
(that is yet to come lol) and in the future being more modular.
